											<h1>Hi, I’m Neilson</h1>
											<p>An 11th Grader with an Interest in Mathematics and Organizations. </p>
										</header>
										<p>Hello! I'm a high school student based in Pekanbaru, Riau. I'm currently studying in Darma Yudha Senior High School as an 11th grader. I have an interest in the study of Mathematics, specifically Olympiad Mathematics. I have participated in various olympiads and won 4 medals in my national math olympiad (INAMO) since elementary school. I'm currently preparing for my country's Team Selection Test for the 67th International Mathematical Olympiad. I also like to join various organizations both in my school and outside of school.</p>

											<h3>My Mathematics Journey</h3>
											<p>I started my Maths Olympiad Journey in elementary school. I have participated in various competitions since then. Some of my proudest achievements are the medals I've won in the Indonesia National Math Olympiad (OSN). I won Absolute Winner in elementary school and middle school. I've also won two silver medals in the high school division. This year, I ranked #8 on the Indonesian TST for the 2025 IMO. I'm currently once again participating in the TST for the 2026 IMO. I also have some experience teaching Olympiad Mathematics.</p>

											<h3>School Organizations</h3>
											<p>During middle school, I started to get interested in organizations and joined my school's Student Council (OSIS) for one year. I learnt a lot of things during my time there. Therefore, in high school I decided to once again join a student's organization. I joined the Student's Representative (MPK) starting from 10th grade. In 2025, I got elected as the President of the Student's Representative for the following year. </p>

											<h3>Community</h3>
											<p>Early 2025, me and my friends decided to start a non-profit organization called Project SPARK. Here, we give back to our community by going to orphanages and spreading awareness for environmental sustainability. During the year, we have done a lot of projects such as PINTAR, GROW, and so on. I'm truly grateful to everyone involved in this project. </p>

											<h3>Personal Life</h3>
											<p>Throughout the years, I've also done some other things. I've been playing the piano since I was little albeit not too seriously. I can speak some Mandarin. I also learned how to read and write Hiragana, Katakana, and Hangul. Other than that, I picked up some basic coding since the year 2024. </p>
